Expense Manager is a simple yet functional expense-tracking application built with C# and SQLite using Windows Forms. This project started as my first foray into WinForms, and surprisingly, it turned out to be a really enjoyable experience.

At first, I thought designing the UI would be a major challenge—I wanted something clean and straightforward, without unnecessary clutter. After several iterations and refinements, I finally landed on a layout that feels intuitive and gets the job done. Version 1.0 definitely gets a pass in that regard!

<p align="justify">The real struggle, though? Getting all the pieces of code to work together seamlessly. Debugging and making sure every part comminucated with every other part was a real pain, but in the end, seeing everything come together was totally worth it.

If you're an aspiring developer looking for a solid first challenge with the above-mentioned stack, I highly recommend starting with something simple like this. It’s far from perfect - the UI might feel a bit clunky, the code may not be the most efficient - but that's all part of the learning process. Every line of code, every bug fixed, and every small improvement adds up to experience, and at the end of the day, that’s what truly matters.</p>
